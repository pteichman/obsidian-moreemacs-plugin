## Obsidian More Emacs Plugin

This is a plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

It implements the following Emacs-like commands with familiar key bindings:
- C-v: scroll-up-command
- M-v: scroll-down-command
- M-d: kill-word
- M-f: forward-word
- M-b: backward-word

The key bindings for each of these can be configured in the Obsidian settings.
